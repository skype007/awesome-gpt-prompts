# Awesome GPT Prompts

This README lists some awesome GPT prompts I tested for my own purposes and their success on GPT-4 AI based tools such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat.
All of the prompts were tested on "Bing Chat" but all should work also on ChatGPT since I took these prompts on medium, Twitter or Instagram posts.
